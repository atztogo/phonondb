# Phono3py input data of 103 compounds made under finite displacement method

## URL links to phono3py finite displacement method inputs of 103 compounds on MDR at NIMS (PBEsol)

Supercell approach with systematic displacements was employed. Forces were computed with PBEsol. These data wer used in A. Togo, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. **92**, 012001 (2023).

## URL links to phono3py finite displacement method inputs of 103 compounds on MDR at NIMS (PBE)

Supercell approach with systematic displacements was employed. Forces were computed with PBE. Thease data were used in A. Togo, L. Chaput, and I. Tanaka, Phys. Rev. B, **91**, 094306 (2015) and A. Seko, *et al.*, Phys. Rev. Lett., **115**, 205901 (2015).
